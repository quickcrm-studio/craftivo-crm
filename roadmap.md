## Development Roadmap & Best Practices

### Phase 1: Project Kickoff & Setup (2 Days)
1. Initialize repositories: mono-repo with `/backend`, `/frontend`, `/infrastructure`; set up `.gitignore`.
2. Environment management: Pyenv/Node Version Manager; define `.env.example` with Dynaconf.
3. Docker baseline: create `Dockerfile` for Django/Next.js; configure `docker-compose.yml` for web, db, redis.
4. CI/CD pipeline: GitHub Actions for linting (flake8, ESLint), type-checking (mypy, TypeScript), basic tests.

### Phase 2: Core Architecture & Auth (3 Days)
1. Django setup: dev/staging/prod settings via Django-environ; install DRF; scaffold API app.
2. User auth: integrate Auth0 or Django Allauth; implement role-based permissions.
3. Next.js auth: secure pages with NextAuth.js or Auth0 SDK; sync roles from backend.

### Phase 3: Customer & Product Models (3 Days)
1. Models & migrations: define `Customer`, `Product`, `Category`; run migrations.
2. Admin & DRF: register models in admin; write serializers and viewsets with filters & pagination.
3. Frontend: React pages for lists/details; use SWR for data fetching & caching.

### Phase 4: Order Management (4 Days)
1. Schema: `Order`, `OrderItem`, `Payment` models linked to `Customer`/`Product`.
2. Status workflows: define states (Pending, Processing, Shipped, Delivered, Canceled), transitions.
3. APIs: DRF ViewSets with actions for status updates and bulk ops.
4. UI: order dashboard with filters, search, real-time status badges.

### Phase 5: Inventory & Alerts (3 Days)
1. Inventory: add `stock_quantity`, `reorder_threshold`; use signals to decrement stock.
2. Low-stock alerts: Celery tasks to scan daily; send emails via Redis queue.
3. Notifications center: React panel + Django Channels for real-time alerts.

### Phase 6: Revenue Analytics & Dashboards (4 Days)
1. Aggregates: monthly revenue, sales by product, customer lifetime value via ORM/SQL.
2. Charts: interactive React components with Recharts; SSR initial data renders.
3. Caching: cache heavy queries in Redis with appropriate TTL.

### Phase 7: Data Export & Reporting (2 Days)
1. Export endpoints: DRF actions for CSV/Excel; use pandas for transforms.
2. Frontend: download page with progress status via Celery polling.

### Phase 8: Testing & QA (3 Days)
1. Backend: Pytest units on models, serializers, views (≥80% coverage).
2. Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library on critical flows.
3. E2E: Cypress tests for login, order flow, dashboard access.

### Phase 9: Infrastructure & Deployment (3 Days)
1. Prod Docker: multi-stage builds, optimized Dockerfiles, Nginx reverse proxy.
2. Cloud: AWS ECS/Fargate + RDS; configure IAM and Secrets Manager.
3. Domain & TLS: domain setup, Certbot for HTTPS enforcement.

### Phase 10: Monitoring, Logging & Maintenance (Ongoing)
1. Logging: Sentry for errors, export logs to CloudWatch.
2. Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.
3. Backups & scaling: automate DB backups; configure auto-scaling policies.
